<h5>Ian Nepomniachtchi, Russia's highest-rated player, has won the Candidates Tournament 
    with one round to go and earned the right to square off against Magnus Carlsen in the 
    World Championship Match scheduled for November 24 - December 16, 2021 in Dubai.

            Nepomniachtchi's closest rival on the crosstable was the Dutch Anish Giri who has had a spectacular second half of the tournament. In Round 13, Giri was dealt a fatal loss at the hands of Alexander Grischuk while Nepomniachtchi was able to hold Maxime Vachier-Lagrave to a draw. With one round remaining, it is theoretically possible for Giri to catch Nepomniachtchi with 8.5 points but because the first tiebreak is head-to-head and Nepomniachtchi beat Giri in their encounter, Nepo will receive the higher tiebreak score and the tournament victory.
            
            Nepomniachtchi should prove to be a very challenging opponent for current World Champion Magnus Carlsen as his record stands at fours wins, one loss, and six draws in classical games.
